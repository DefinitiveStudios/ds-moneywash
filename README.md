Simple Moneywash Script for QBCore. It is open source, so anything you would like to change, convert or use is up to you. The interior is off FiveM mods but you can just move your target zones wherever you like in the config.

I might make some tweaks to it in the future, but it's functional out of the box. I will not be doing an ESX version, different target system / inventory. This is strictly designed with things I utilize and offering to others to use
